# üöÄ Elevator Control System (FPGA + ModelSim + RTL Design)

This project implements a **multi-floor elevator control system** using **VHDL/Verilog**.  
It is designed to run on both **Intel DE1-SoC FPGA (Cyclone V 5CSEMA5F31C6N)** and **ModelSim** for simulation.

| Directory | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **FPGA_Quartz/** | Contains the Quartus Prime project for the DE1-SoC FPGA board. The system is synthesized to run at 50 MHz and tested on Cyclone V. |
| **ModelSim_Simulation/** | Includes simulation files with a 1-cycle testbench clock for functional verification in ModelSim. |
| **System_Design/** | Contains the FSM (Finite State Machine) and RTL (Register Transfer Level) designs for the full system, along with diagrams and requirement documents. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

The elevator system supports multiple floors and models the real behavior of an elevator using FSM and timing logic.

### Core Components
- **FSM Controller** ‚Äî Controls the elevator states: Idle, Moving Up, Moving Down, Door Open, etc.  
- **Floor Counter** ‚Äî Tracks current floor and handles floor requests.  
- **Request Handler** ‚Äî Processes user input for target floors.  
- **Timing Logic** ‚Äî Simulates movement delay between floors.

## üß™ Simulation

- Simulation environment: **ModelSim**  
- Testbench includes:
  - Floor request inputs
  - Timing control
  - State observation (waveforms)

To run:
```bash
vsim -do modelsim.do
